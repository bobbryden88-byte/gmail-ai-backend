# Google Payments Profile Setup for Stripe Extension

## Important Context
Your extension uses **Stripe for payments**, not Google's payment system. This means:
- ✅ You don't need Google's payment processing
- ✅ You only need a basic Google Payments profile for account verification
- ✅ Stripe handles all actual payment processing

## Google Payments Profile Setup Steps

### 1. Basic Profile Information
Since you're using Stripe, you only need to provide basic information:

**Business Information:**
- **Business Name**: "Robert Bryden" (or create a business name like "Gmail AI Assistant")
- **Business Type**: "Sole Proprietorship" (unless you have a formal business)
- **Address**: Your home/business address
- **Country**: Canada

### 2. Payment Processing Setup
**Important**: You can skip most payment processing setup since you're using Stripe:

- **Payment Methods**: Select "I don't accept payments through Google" or "Other payment methods"
- **Bank Account**: You can add a basic bank account (it won't be used for payments)
- **Tax Information**: Provide basic tax info (required for verification)

### 3. Identity Verification
You'll need to provide:
- **Government ID**: Driver's license or passport
- **Proof of Address**: Utility bill or bank statement
- **Phone Number**: For verification

### 4. What Google Needs to Know
When setting up the profile, mention:
- **"This extension uses Stripe for payment processing"**
- **"Google Payments is only needed for account verification"**
- **"All transactions are handled by Stripe"**

## Stripe vs Google Payments

### Your Current Setup (Stripe):
- ✅ Users pay through Stripe checkout
- ✅ Stripe handles all payment processing
- ✅ You receive payments directly to your bank account
- ✅ Stripe handles taxes and compliance

### Google Payments Profile Purpose:
- ✅ Account verification only
- ✅ Compliance with Chrome Web Store requirements
- ✅ Business identity verification
- ❌ NOT used for actual payment processing

## Setup Options

### Option 1: Minimal Setup (Recommended)
1. **Provide basic business information**
2. **Add a bank account** (won't be used for payments)
3. **Complete identity verification**
4. **Select "Other payment methods" or "External payment processing"**

### Option 2: Full Setup (If Required)

## Common Questions & Answers

### Q: "Do I need to set up Google Pay?"
**A**: No, since you're using Stripe. You can select "Other payment methods" or "External payment processing."

### Q: "What if Google requires payment setup?"
**A**: You can set up a basic Google Pay account and then configure your extension to use Stripe instead.

### Q: "Will users see Google Pay options?"
**A**: No, since your extension directs users to Stripe checkout pages.
